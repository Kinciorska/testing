# Pytest Tutorial Project

This is a project created to learn Python testing using the pytest framework. I followed the tutorial from [freeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYq1MRoyI0&t=1553s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org).

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kinciorska/testing.git
    cd Testing
    ```

2. Set up the Python virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install Python dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the tests

1. Move to the tests directory:

    ```bash
    cd tests
    ```
2. Start the tests using the command below. Replace "filename" with the file you want to test.

   ```bash
    pytest filename.py
   ```
